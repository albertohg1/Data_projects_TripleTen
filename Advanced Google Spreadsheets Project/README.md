# Advanced Google Spreadsheets: NYC Airbnb Data

## Project Description
This project involved analyzing the vacation rental market in the Manhattan borough of New York City using data from Airbnb listings. The goal was to provide guidance to a client interested in investing in vacation properties by identifying key insights regarding profitability, occupancy rates, and optimal property characteristics.

## Problems Solved
- **Identifying Key Profit and Loss Areas**: The analysis helps pinpoint which types of properties generate the most profit and which ones should be avoided.
- **Neighborhood Insights**: The project highlights the most attractive neighborhoods for vacation rentals based on rental activity and occupancy rates.
- **Occupancy Rate Calculation**: Calculated occupancy rates for various listings, offering insights into rental patterns.
- **Revenue Estimation**: Provided revenue forecasts based on pricing and occupancy data for potential investment properties.
- **Return Rate for Listings**: Assessed return rates to determine the viability of long-term property investments.

## Key Tasks and Methodology
1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**:
   - Reviewed and cleaned the NYC Airbnb dataset (listings and calendar data).
   - Filtered out irrelevant data such as long-term rentals and listings without recent reviews.

2. **Target Property Recommendations**:
   - Estimated rental activity using review counts.
   - Standardized neighborhood labels and focused on vacation rentals with 7 days or fewer as the minimum stay.

3. **Occupancy and Property Size Analysis**:
   - Created pivot tables to calculate occupancy rates.
   - Recommended specific property sizes based on occupancy data, focusing on top-performing neighborhoods.

4. **Revenue Estimation**:
   - Calculated average price and occupancy rates to estimate annual revenue for each property type and neighborhood.

5. **Visualization of Key Metrics**:
   - Used advanced pivot tables to visualize performance metrics such as most popular neighborhoods, property sizes, and occupancy rates.

6. **Final Recommendations**:
   - Provided insights on the best neighborhoods and property types for investment.
   - Identified the best months and states for targeted advertising based on historical occupancy rates.

## Findings
- **Top 10 Most Popular Neighborhoods**: High rental activity was observed in neighborhoods like the Lower East Side and West Village.
- **Best Property Size**: One- and two-bedroom apartments were the most in-demand, particularly in high-traffic areas.
- **Average Occupancy Rates**: Properties exhibited occupancy rates between 60% and 100%, depending on location and amenities.
- **Revenue Projections**: The projected revenue based on average price and occupancy indicated that properties in the West Village offered the highest potential returns.
- **Superhost and Amenities Impact**: Properties with "Superhost" status, "Instant Booking," and doorman services consistently performed better in terms of occupancy and reviews.
- **Advertising Insights**: Certain months, based on occupancy trends, presented optimal opportunities for targeted advertising.

## Tools Used
- **Google Sheets**: Advanced data filtering, pivot tables, and calculated fields.
